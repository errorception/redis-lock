redis-lock
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/errorception/redis-lock.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/errorception/redis-lock)

Implements a locking primitive using redis in node.js.

Fully non-blocking and asynchronous, and uses the algorithm described in the [redis docs](https://redis.io/commands/setnx).

Useful for concurrency control. For example, when updating a database record you might want to ensure that no other part of your code is updating the same record at that time.

Used heavily at [errorception](http://errorception.com/).

Starting Node 8, you can promisify the lock function

## Example

```javascript
var client = require("redis").createClient(),
	lock = require("redis-lock")(client);

lock("myLock", function(done) {
	// No one else will be able to get a lock on 'myLock' until you call done()
	done();
});
```

Slightly more descriptive example:
```javascript
var client = require("redis").createClient(),
	lock = require("redis-lock")(client);

lock("myLock", function(done) {
	// Simulate a 1 second long operation
	setTimeout(done, 1000);
});

lock("myLock", function(done) {
	// Even though this function has been scheduled at the same time
	// as the function above, this callback will not be executed till
	// the function above has called done(). Hence, this will have to
	// wait for at least 1 second.

	done();
});
```

## Installation

	$ npm install redis-lock


## Usage

``redis-lock`` is really simple to use - It's just a function!

### Initialization

To initialize redis-lock, simply call it by passing in a redis client instance, created by calling ``.createClient()`` on the excellent [node-redis](https://github.com/redis/node-redis). This is taken in as a parameter because you might want to configure the client to suit your environment (host, port, etc.), and to enable you to reuse the client from your app if you want to.

You can also provide a second (optional) parameter: `retryDelay`. If due to any reason a lock couldn't be acquired, lock acquisition is retried after waiting for a little bit of time. `retryDelay` lets you control this delay time. Default: 50ms.

```javascript
var lock = require("redis-lock")(require("redis").createClient(), 10);
```

This will return a function called (say) ``lock``, described below:

### lock(lockName, [timeout = 5000], cb)

* ``lockName``: Any name for a lock. Must follow redis's key naming rules. Make this as granular as you can. For example, to get a lock when editing record 1 in the database, call the lock ``record1`` rather than ``database``, so that other records in the database can be modified even as you are holding this lock.
* ``timeout``: (Optional) The maximum time (in ms) to hold the lock for. If this time is exceeded, the lock is automatically released to prevent deadlocks. Default: 5000 ms (5 seconds).
* ``cb``: The function to call when the lock has been acquired. This function gets one argument - a method called (say) ``done`` which should be called to release the lock.

The ``done`` function can optionally take a callback function as an argument, in case you want to be notified when the lock has been really released, though I don't know why you'd want that.

Full example, with ``console.log`` calls to illustrate the flow:
```javascript
var client = require("redis").createClient(),
	lock = require("redis-lock")(client);

console.log("Asking for lock");
lock("myLock", function(done) {
	console.log("Lock acquired");

	setTimeout(function() {		// Simulate some task
		console.log("Releasing lock now");

		done(function() {
			console.log("Lock has been released, and is available for others to use");
		});
	}, 2000);
});
```

## Use with promises and async/await.

Starting node 8.x, you can use `util.promisify` to promisify the lock.
```javascript
const client = require('redis').createClient();
const { promisify } = require('util');
const lock = promisify(require('redis-lock')(client));

lock('lockString').then(unlock => {
	// Perform your task
	unlock();
});
```

Or even better, with `async`/`await`:
```javascript
const client = require('redis').createClient();
const { promisify } = require('util');
const lock = promisify(require('redis-lock')(client));

const unlock = await lock('lockString');
// Perform your task;
unlock();
```

The `unlock` function is internally promisified, so you can `await` for when the lock is released.

Possible pattern for use with `async`/`await`, with error bubbling, and reliable unlocking:
```javascript
const unlock = await lock('lockString');
try {
	// Perform you task
} catch (e) {
	throw e;
} finally {
	unlock();
}
```

The promisified version might become the default in future versions, depending on adoption of promises and async/await. For now, though this module handles promises correctly internally, the act of promisifying is left to the caller.

## Details

* It's guaranteed that only one function will be called at a time for the same lock.
* This module doesn't block the event loop. All operations are completely asynchronous and non-blocking.
* If two functions happen to ask for a lock simultaneously, the execution of the second function is deferred until the first function has released its lock or has timed out.
* It's not possible for two functions to acquire the same lock at any point in time, except if the timeout is breached.
* If the timeout is breached, the lock is released, and the next function coming along and asking for a lock acquires the lock.
* Since it's asynchronous, different functions could be holding different locks simultaneously. This is awesome!
* If redis is down for any reason, none of the functions are given locks, and none of the locks are released. The code will keep polling to check if redis is available again to acquire the lock.
